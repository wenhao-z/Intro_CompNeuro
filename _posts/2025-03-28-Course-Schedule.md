### Course Schedule

#### Day 1 (April 1, 2025)

#### Morning

1.  Intro of Computational Neuroscience (30 mins. 9 - 9:30AM. Lecturer: WHZ)
	- Why do we study it? 
	- How can it be useful? 
	- The philosophy of model building.
2. Basics of mathematics (1 hr. 9:30 - 10AM. Lecturer: EGS)
	- First order linear differential equation (homogeneous &  inhomogeneous solutions; numerical methods: Euler)
3. Single neuron model (10:15AM - Noon. Lecturer: WHZ)
	- Brief introduction of single neuron's physiology
	- Brief introduction of Huxley-Hudgkin model
	- Detailed introduction of Integration-and-Fire (IF) model
	- Firing-rate neuron models (Sec. 7.2 in Dayan & Abbott's textbook)
#### Afternoon (1:30PM - 5PM)
Numerical simulations of IF model
To Do:
	- Prepare a sample code and an incomplete code
		- We type in all IF model parameters
		- Let students write the iterative equation in the code. We can provide the math of discrete equation in the Markdown block above the Python code block.
	- The codes of rastergram of spike timing (we can directly give them to students)

#### Day 2 (April 3, 2025)

#### Morning (9AM - Noon)
1. Basics of mathematics (9 - 9:30AM. Lecturer: EGS)
	- Linear algebra (vector, matrix, eigenvectors and eigenvalues; Refer to Dayan &Abbott's textbook's Math Appendix)
2. Network model Session I (9:45 - 10:50AM. Lecturer: WHZ)
	1. Feedforward network
	2. Linear recurrent network (Sec. 7.4 in Dayan & Abbott's textbook)
		- Eigen-analysis of the linear recurrent dynamics
		- Selective amplification
		- Input integration
3. Network model session II (11AM - Noon. Lecturer: WHZ)
	1. Continuous linear Recurrent networks 
	2. Continuous attractor network: nonlinear, continuous recurrent networks
		- Continuous stimulus representation
		- Winner-Take-All input selection
		- Gain modulation
		- Sustained activity
		- A brief introduction of network sampling

#### Afternoon (1:30 - 5PM)
Numerical simulations of continuous attractor network
